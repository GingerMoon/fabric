You can replace your own executable binary "peer" with our executable binary peer directly.
(Our peer is customized based on Fabric 1.4)

Below are more details in case you want to build the customized peer by yourself.

Prerequisites:
Since the code change is based on Fabric 1.4, so the prerequisites are the same as Fabric 1.4:
https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/prereqs.html

Repository:
https://bitbucket.org/accelorteam/fabric/src/238c062c29a39b1ce1fbc1528c5095bb7b3fa69e/?at=feature%2Fvscc-mvcc

Build steps (linux):
1. mkdir $GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperledger
2. cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperledger
3. git clone https://GingerMoon@bitbucket.org/accelorteam/fabric.git
4. cd fabric/peer
5. go build
6. the executable binary file peer was generated under the current path.
